Game Requirements Document: Boss Battles & Items System
1. Overview

This document outlines the design, mechanics, and implementation details for the boss battles, item system, inventory management, and battle screen in the arcade platformer game. The goal is to make battles strategic, immersive, and visually engaging, while integrating Web3 mechanics such as limited-use items and progression.

2. Boss System
2.1 Boss Frequency

A boss appears every 2 floors in the tower.

These are main bosses, harder than normal NPC encounters.

Players must defeat the boss to progress to higher floors.

2.2 Boss Behavior

Each boss has:

HP bar

Strengths and weaknesses against item types

Unique attacks and animations

Bosses have phases triggered at specific HP thresholds (50%, 20%), modifying attack patterns and strategy.

2.3 Current Boss Roster (5 Bosses)

Flame Titan

Strong against: Fire-based attacks

Weak against: Ice-based attacks

Signature move: Firewave (AOE damage across player area)

Visuals: Lava cracks, fiery aura

Sound: Roaring flames, rumbling lava

Toxic Queen

Strong against: Poison attacks

Weak against: Electric or Blood attacks

Signature move: Toxin Spray (applies stacking poison)

Visuals: Green mist, venomous spikes

Sound: Hissing, bubbling liquid

Ironclad Golem

Strong against: Physical/attack dice

Weak against: Acid and Fire items

Signature move: Shield Slam (stuns player, reduces attack effectiveness)

Visuals: Metallic sheen, sparks on impact

Sound: Clanking, heavy footsteps

Frost Warden

Strong against: Ice attacks

Weak against: Fire or Wind items

Signature move: Ice Barrage (slows player movement and dice roll timing)

Visuals: Frost-covered armor, snow flurries

Sound: Ice cracking, chilling wind

Shadow Reaper

Strong against: Shadow or trickster items

Weak against: Light, Fire, or Blood items

Signature move: Soul Drain (steals HP from player, boosts own HP)

Visuals: Dark aura, swirling shadow effects

Sound: Whispering, echoing strikes

3. Item System
3.1 Item Types

Attack Items: Fire Oil, Poison Vial, Acid Flask, Lightning Shard, Ice Charm

Utility Items: Smoke Bomb, Shield Potion, Frost Barrier, Mirror Crystal

Healing Items: Medkit, Bandages, Antibiotics (cures poison or debuffs)

3.2 Mechanics

Items are one-time use, applied before rolling an attack dice.

Each item applies an effect to the next dice roll or action.

Some items may have side effects (e.g., Fire Oil can also damage the player if misused).

3.3 Item Effect Examples

Fire Oil: Adds burn damage over 3 turns, triggers fire particles on high rolls.

Poison Vial: Stacks poison, small damage per turn.

Acid Flask: Reduces boss armor for next 2 rolls.

Ice Charm: Freezes or slows boss for 1 turn.

Antibiotics: Neutralizes poison or toxin effects on player.

3.4 Visuals

Dice glow in the corresponding element’s color.

Boss reacts visually: armor melting, poison cloud, frost covering, sparks.

Particle effects emphasize elemental impact.

4. Inventory System
4.1 Inventory Rules

Inventory space: 50 units total

Item cost: Each item occupies 5 units

Starting inventory: Player starts with 1 of each item and 1 of each antibiotic (total 12 items)

Players must manage inventory space, creating strategic choices for battles.

4.2 Usage

During preparation or mid-battle, players select items to use on upcoming dice rolls.

Once used, the item is removed from inventory.

Items can be replenished through gacha boxes, missions, or shop purchases.

5. Battle Screen
5.1 Layout

Player: Positioned on the left

Boss: Positioned on the right

Dice selection panel: Bottom center or bottom left, showing all dice and applied items

HP bars: Top left (player) and top right (boss)

Buff/debuff icons: Above character portraits to show active effects

Environment: Dynamic based on floor and boss type (lava, poison mist, ice, shadows)

5.2 Interactions

Players select dice and items each turn.

Boss performs AI actions each turn, visually represented with animations.

Dice rolls trigger visual effects tied to the dice type and applied items.

5.3 Audio

Background music: Boss-specific tracks

SFX: Dice roll, attack, item usage, boss attack, critical hits, environmental hazards

Audio changes dynamically with boss phases or critical events (e.g., low HP, special attack triggers)

6. Battle Flow

Player selects dice and applies items.

Roll dice → triggers effects based on dice type + item modifiers.

Boss responds with AI attack or special move.

Update HP, buffs/debuffs, and visual feedback.

Repeat until player or boss HP reaches zero.

Upon boss defeat: loot item rewards, gacha spins, and progression to next floor.

Player inventory and item cooldowns updated.

7. Web3 Integration Considerations

Items and tickets can be tokenized for ownership, trades, or rare drops.

Leaderboards track highest floors, fastest boss kills, or XP.

Items can be rewarded as part of Web3 incentives for top performers or gacha purchases.

8. Key Requirements for Development Team

Implement boss AI system with strengths, weaknesses, and signature moves

Create elemental item system, including visual effects, inventory, and usage rules

Build battle screen layout with dice, HP, buffs/debuffs, and dynamic environment

Implement battle music and SFX triggers for each action

Design inventory management and item consumption rules

Ensure boss phase mechanics (triggered at specific HP thresholds)
